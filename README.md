# ScratchWeb

Someone in a scratch forum thread asked if it was possible to create a website with scratch. The answer of course is technically yes but requires familliality with api's  and web development, a skill which some people on scratch may not know. To allow people to do this and create their own website with an easy and familliar language I created ScratchWeb.

Unfortunatly to share it on scratch I have to build in certain restrictions to the site. These include:

Images are restricted to scratch domains only such as cdn2 and assets,

JavaScript cannot be run on the site (I do not want to be responsible for a breach of GDPR),

Links can only link to scratch domains or other ScratchWeb sites,

ScratchWeb **will refuse** to load unshared projects,

The site cannot be edited globally as raw html.

If you have any questions contact me on [my scratch profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/-EmeraldThunder-)

Also please note this is far from complete I have a huge list of features (and a few bug fixes) that need implementing. I am working on all of this so just be patient.

*Documentation is on the way*
